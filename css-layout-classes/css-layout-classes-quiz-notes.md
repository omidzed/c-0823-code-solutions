  row

- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?)
  Container, rows, columns

- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**?
  1... technically there is no strict minimum.

  To create a centralized and often constrained area for your site/app's content to be. It allows for content centering, padding/margins, a grid system, which leads to having a responsive design.
