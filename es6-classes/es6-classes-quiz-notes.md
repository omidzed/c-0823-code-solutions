## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are JavaScript classes?
  Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

- When would you want to use a class?
  When you want to represent real-world entities in a more organized and intuitive way. This way your objects will have structure, encapsulation, be reusable more easily, and take advantage of things like inheritence and polymorphism.

- How do you declare a class?
  By writing a class ClassName {
  // class body
  } and inside the body we would have a constructor() and methods()

- How do you inherit from another class?
  By using keyword 'extends'

- Why would you want to inherit from another class?
  So you can use all the protoype properties and use cases that it already has and you can put to use.

- How do you add methods and properties to a class?
  By creating them inside the class's body. You need to use the 'this' keyword to add properties. and for methods you just need the method name, no need for 'function' keyword, and they would go below the constructor in the class body.
