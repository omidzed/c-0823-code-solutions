## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
  Block-level elements have a significant impact on the document flow, which is the arrangement and presentation of elements on a web page.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
  Inline elements do not cause line breaks before or after themselves. They sit within the normal flow of text and do not disrupt it.

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
  Width - By default, a block-level element will stretch to fill the width of its parent container. If no width is specified, it will expand to fill the available width.
  Height - The height of a block-level element is determined by its content. By default, the height will expand to accommodate its content without a scroll bar.

- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  Width - The width of an inline element depends on its content. An inline element does not have a default width, it simply spans as wide as its content width.
  Height - The height of an inline element is determined by the font-size. Inline elements have a default height equal to the line-height set for the font-size.
