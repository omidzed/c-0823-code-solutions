## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  It is reusable code that greatly benefits new and experienced programmers alike.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function, a name, parameters which are surrounded by parentheses; code block as indicated by an braces, and finally an optional return statement inside the code block.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call is just the name of the function, followed by () which will include the arguments passed on to it seperated by commas.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The call will not have the keyword 'function' nor will it have the code block, just the name and the arguments which are inside the paranthesis.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  We call the generic data that are passed to a function 'parameters' at the time of defining the function,
  but when this generic data becomes actual data which we pass to function while making a function call 'arguments.'
  So it comes down to the instance of reference, defintion vs call.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Because they allow functions to be flexible and have different use cases and outputs.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
