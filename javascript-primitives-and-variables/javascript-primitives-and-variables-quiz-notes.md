  by using '=' followed by some value, followed by a semicolon.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?

In JavaScript, variable names must have heir first character be an uppercase or lowercase letter, an underscore (\_), or a dollar sign ($) and any subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  It means a variable named x and one named X are not the same, and treated as two completely different and seperate values declared.
