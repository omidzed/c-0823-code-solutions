## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?
  Event.target refers to where the event takes place, not necessarily which element the eventListener was attached to.

- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  The element will not show on the page.

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  It takes selectors as arguments. It returns true if the Element matches the selectors. Otherwise, false.

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  .getAttribute() method

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  At all steps, you can never do too much logging.

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  Would need to add event listeners to each of the new child elements.

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  Use if/else statements for each tab and view, and get very long and messy
